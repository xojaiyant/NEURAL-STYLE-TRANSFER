# NEURAL-STYLE-TRANSFER
Neural Style Transfer (NST) is an advanced computer vision technique that applies the artistic style of one image (style image) to the content of another image (content image), creating a visually striking combination of both. This project demonstrates the implementation of NST using a pre-trained deep learning model (VGG19) available through PyTorchâ€™s torchvision library.

The system works by extracting features from both the content and style images using a convolutional neural network (CNN). It computes content loss (to preserve structure) and style loss (to transfer artistic patterns), then optimizes a target image to minimize these losses. The result is a new image that retains the shapes and layout of the content image but reflects the artistic patterns and brushstrokes of the style image.

The project uses Python along with libraries like torch, torchvision, PIL, and matplotlib. The final deliverable is a Python script that takes in two input images, performs style transfer, and outputs a styled image saved as stylized_output.jpg.

This task highlights the power of deep learning in creative AI applications, merging technology with art to produce visually compelling results.
